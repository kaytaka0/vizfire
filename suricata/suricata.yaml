# Suricata Configuration File
# This file contains the configuration for Suricata, the network IDS/IPS.

# (1) Variables (vars)
# Define variables for your network environment here.
# `HOME_NET` is crucial for defining the network you are protecting.
vars:
  # Set `HOME_NET` to your internal network IP range.
  # Leaving it as `any` will cause many rules to not work correctly.
  # Example: "192.168.0.0/16"
  address-groups:
    HOME_NET: "[172.28.0.0/16]"
    CLIENT_IP: "[172.28.0.10]"
    SERVER_IP: "[172.28.0.30]"

    # EXTERNAL_NET is defined as everything that is not HOME_NET.
    EXTERNAL_NET: "!$HOME_NET"

    # Define specific server IPs for more detailed rules.
    HTTP_SERVERS: "$HOME_NET"
    SMTP_SERVERS: "$HOME_NET"
    DNS_SERVERS: "$HOME_NET"

  port-groups:
    HTTP_PORTS: "80"
    SHELLCODE_PORTS: "!80"
    ORACLE_PORTS: 1521
    SSH_PORTS: 22

# (2) Host OS Policy (host-os-policy)
# Define the operating systems of your servers and clients.
# This improves the accuracy of rules that target specific OS vulnerabilities.
host-os-policy:
  linux: [172.28.0.0/16]

# (3) Rule and Classification Settings
# Specify the rule files and classification configurations for Suricata.

# File that defines event priorities and classifications.
classification-file: /etc/suricata/classification.config

# File that defines URL prefixes for the `reference` keyword.
reference-config-file: /etc/suricata/reference.config

# (4) Rule Files Loading (rule-files)
# Specify the rule files you want Suricata to load.
# You can add your own custom rules here, like `custom.rules`.
rule-files:
  - custom.rules

# (5) Detection Engine and Performance (engine-analysis)
engine-analysis:
  detect-engine-profile: medium
  cpu-affinity:
    - 0

# (6) Output Settings (outputs)
outputs:
  - console:
      enabled: yes
  - file:
      enabled: no
      filename: /var/log/suricata/suricata.log
  # EVE log (JSON format) settings. Central for SIEM integration.
  - eve-log:
      enabled: yes
      filetype: regular # regular or unix_stream
      filename: /var/log/suricata/eve.json
      # Select the types of logs you want to output.
      # e.g., alert, http, dns, tls, flow, fileinfo, ssh, smtp, stats
      types:
        - alert:
            # Include http, dns, etc., info in alerts
            payload-printable: yes
        - http:
            extended: yes # Record more detailed HTTP information
        - dns:
            extended: yes
        - tls:
            extended: yes
        - flow
        - fileinfo:
            force-magic: yes # Force magic number check for file types
            force-md5: yes   # Force MD5 hash calculation

# (7) Packet Acquisition Method (af-packet for Linux)
# Settings for high-speed packet acquisition in a Linux environment.
# Change `eth0` to the network interface you want to monitor.
af-packet:
  - interface: eth0
    # Number of threads. Often matched to the number of queues on the interface.
    threads: 1
    # `autofp` mode uses RSS (Receive Side Scaling) to distribute the load.
    cluster-type: cluster_flow
    cluster-id: 99
    defrag: yes
    use-mmap: yes

  - interface: eth1
    # Number of threads. Often matched to the number of queues on the interface.
    threads: 1
    # `autofp` mode uses RSS (Receive Side Scaling) to distribute the load.
    cluster-type: cluster_flow
    cluster-id: 98
    defrag: yes
    use-mmap: yes
# (8) PCAP Live Mode (pcap)
# Used in environments where af-packet is not available (e.g., BSD, macOS) or for testing.
pcap:
  - interface: eth0

# (9) Stream Engine Settings
# Configuration for the stream engine, which handles TCP reassembly, etc.
stream:
  memcap: 256mb
  checksum-validation: yes # Enable/disable checksum validation

# (10) Application Layer Parser Settings
# Enable/disable parsers for application layer protocols like HTTP, DNS, TLS.
app-layer:
  protocols:
    http:
      enabled: yes
    dns:
      enabled: yes
    tls:
      enabled: yes
    ssh:
